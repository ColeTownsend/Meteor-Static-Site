      <p>My name is Cole Townsend I am a designer, a runner, and a Buffalonian. I studied Art History at Williams College. I like chemex coffee, running, and napping in that order. I think programming is cool,
        <del>but don’t actually program that much</del> and I learned python then built <a href="http://coletownsend.github.io/ben-cole-project/">this Tour de France visualization</a>. I’m always trying to learn new things. MeteorJS and FramerJS are on my shortlist. I recently built <em>this very site</em> in Meteor and made a <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2131589-Meta-culously-Organized">neat little animation</a> in Framer.

        I had a running blog, and I still have one. It's called How To Run Free. It started as a template default Wordpress blog. Then I got a hold of the css file...and the rest is history.
