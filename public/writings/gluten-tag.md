There's something about a terrible beer pun that always draws a smile and a chuckle. My friend often joked about opening up a brewery called Gluten Tag, which proudly served gluten rich beer.

Gluten Tag was born on a lazy Friday afternoon while I drank one of my friend's freshly ready batches. It was crisp. It made me feel pretty darn good about myself. Being bored and then full of beer, I pawed through some medieval woodcut prints. I knew that with this print, I wanted some fine germanic blackletter. I found an awesome typeface on Creative Market. 

Pairing the two, I created a quick simple logo in just under an hour that was cost effective, time effective, and captured the essence of the brewery.
